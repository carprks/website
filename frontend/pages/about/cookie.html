            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">We use a few monitoring tools, such as cookies and web beacons, on our "platforms": websites, mobile apps, emails, text messages and social media accounts. This is to make sure our platforms work properly and to give you a great experience when you're booking a parking spot with us.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">This Statement explains what those cookies and other tools do.

            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">A cookie is a small text file that is placed in your device's browser when you use a platform. Most platforms use cookies to store useful bits of information for lots of different purposes. This information can include your sign-in name, the items in your shopping cart, or your preferences (for example, your preferred language and currency). This lets a platform recognise your device and provide a better, smoother experience.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">Cookies can be “session cookies” or “permanent cookies”. Session cookies are automatically deleted when you close your device's browser; permanent cookies stay in your browser until you delete them, or your browser deletes them based on the cookies’ duration period. Permanent cookies allow platforms to remember your preferences for when you visit them again, speeding up and enhancing your experience of the services we offer.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">"First-party cookies" are cookies set by the company whose platform you're using. When we use the term, it means CarPark.ninja's own cookies. "Third-party cookies" are cookies set by a company that has a relationship of some kind with the platform you're using. When we use the term, it means cookies set by our affiliates and by other business partners, including third-party service providers and advertisers.</p>

            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">A web beacon is a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that can be delivered to your computer as part of a web page request, in an app, in an advert, or in an HTML email message. Web beacons can be used for many purposes – including site traffic reporting, counting unique visitors, advertising, auditing, reporting and personalisation. They also help us to monitor our site and to ensure that each page is loading properly and quickly.</p>

            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">We use these technologies to collect usage and preference information about you over time and across different platforms. So, do our business partners, including third-party service providers and advertisers that we work with.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">Some adverts may be delivered to you by third-party online advertising and marketing companies. These companies use certain technologies to deliver adverts and marketing messages. They also use them to collect non-personally identifiable information about the adverts they display, and about your visit to (or use of) our platforms. They do this by placing a cookie on your computer so it can read your IP address. We do our best to work with third-party online advertising and marketing companies that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), and that adhere to industry standards and codes of conduct.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">At CarPark.ninja, we use a variety of cookies to do different things:</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1"><strong>Technical cookies</strong>: To give you user-friendly platforms that function correctly and that adapt automatically to you, to create your user account, to sign you in, and to manage your bookings. Technical cookies are absolutely necessary to make our platforms work properly for you.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1"><strong>Functional cookies</strong>: To remember any preferences you set when you visit our platforms, such as your preferred language and currency. They can also remember your sign-in credentials, so you don't have to re-enter them every time. Our platforms would still work without functional cookies, but the experience wouldn’t be as smooth, fast and simple.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1"><strong>Analytics cookies</strong>: To help us improve and optimise our platforms. We (or our third-party service providers) may use them to gather aggregated or segmented information about visitors, so we can see how effective and relevant our adverts are. That information can include what web pages and adverts you viewed that enabled you to reach our platforms, what referring/exit pages you arrived and left from, which platform you used, how you interacted with our platform, what search criteria you used, and which emails you opened and acted upon. We do not use this information to personally identify you.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1"><strong>Commercial cookies</strong>: To work with online advertising companies to display personalised adverts when you visit our platforms and third-party platforms. This is called "retargeting" and may be based on your browsing activities, such as what you do on our platforms, or which destinations you have been searching for a parking spot in. Our business partners may also give us information about your browsing history to help us make sure our platforms deliver the most relevant, personalised experience.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">We also use Google Analytics, which is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic, and helps us identify pages that are slow, broken or poorly performing. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics">www.google.co.uk/analytics</a></p>

            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">The first time you visit one of our platforms, we will ask you to “opt in” (i.e. consent) to our use of cookies and monitoring tools. If you choose not to accept certain technical and/or functional cookies, you won’t enjoy full use of our platforms’ functions, and the overall experience won’t be as smooth or as fast.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">And you can opt in or out at any time by visiting our <a href="/account/cookie">Cookie portal</a>.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">You can also use your browser to control how cookies are used on your device. Check your browser's help menu to find out how.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">NAI and IAB members allow you to opt out of behavioural advertising if you so wish. Visit <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a> to identify the NAI members that may have placed an advertising cookie file on your computer. To opt out of an NAI member’s behavioural advertising programme, just check the box for the company you want to opt out from.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">Please visit <a href="https://www.youradchoices.com">www.youradchoices.com</a> (an English-language site) or <a href="https//www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a> to find out about these companies' own privacy policies, about the technologies they use, and about opting out of this kind of advertising. If you opt out of an online advertising network, it will no longer show you adverts tailored to your web preferences and browsing patterns. However, you may still receive online adverts, and you may still be subject to marketing analysis.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">We may change this Cookie Statement from time to time; please check back here for any updates.</p>
