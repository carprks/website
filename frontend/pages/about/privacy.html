            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">We can’t help you make a booking or request a quote without certain information. When you do either of those things, we ask you for the information we need so we can give you what you want. This is pretty standard stuff and may include your name, and contact details (email, address and phone number). It can also include your payment information.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">In addition, we collect information from your computer when you use one of our platforms, even if you don’t make a booking. This may include your IP address, which browser you use, and your language settings. There are also situations where we receive information about you from third parties, or automatically collect other information. This is a basic overview of the information we collect. Would you like to know more?</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">We store and use the information that you give us. When you make a booking, we need at least your name, email address and payment information. We might also ask for your phone number.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">If you get in touch with us (by phone, by email or through social media, for example) we will collect information from you there too.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">After your booking, we may ask you to provide a review to help us improve our services, and to help ensure future customers get exactly what they’re looking for.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">There are also other ways you might give us information. For example, if you’re browsing with your mobile device, you can share your current location with us, so we can provide you with the best possible service. To make things easier, you can also open a user account, which lets you review and manage your bookings, as well as saving your personal settings. It also makes it easier to make future bookings.</p>

This may include your IP address, which pages you’ve visited, which browser you’re using, and information about clicks.

            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">We ask for your personal data so we can book your parking spot (and anything else you need for your booking), and make sure you get the best possible service. We also use it to contact you, and to tell you about our latest deals and special offers. These are the main reasons we collect your personal data, but there are other reasons too. Would you like to know more?</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">We may use your personal data in the following ways:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside p-3">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Bookings</strong>: First and foremost, we use your personal data to make and administer your booking, and to forward the necessary details to the company that provides your parking spot (or other product or service, such as park and ride). This includes sending you communications in relation to your booking, such as confirmations, modifications and reminders.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Customer reviews</strong>: We may use your contact details to send you a short questionnaire about your booking. This helps us understand and improve our service and the service our business partners provide.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Account facilities</strong>: To make things easier, you can create a user account on our platforms. This involves giving us your personal data, and it lets you do a number of useful things. You can manage your bookings or other purchases, take advantage of special offers, and manage your personal settings and preferences. It also makes it easier to make future bookings.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>Marketing activities</strong>: We also use your personal data for marketing activities, which may include:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-3">
                        <li class="mb-2">Contacting you by phone, email or SMS (depending on the contact details you give us) with our latest news, special offers, discounts and updates, including details of our products and services (and/or those of our group companies or affiliate business partners). You can unsubscribe from these marketing communications quickly, easily and at any time – just click the “unsubscribe” link in any email or visit our <a href="/account/data">Data Subject Request Portal</a>.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Showing you relevant offers on our platforms or on third-party websites, including social media sites.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">nviting you to participate in promotional activities (such as referral programs or competitions).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>Communicating with you</strong>: There may be other times when we contact you by phone, email or SMS. There could be a number of reasons for this, including:
                    <ul class="list-decimal list-inside pl-3">
                        <li class="mb-2">Responding to, and handling any requests you have made.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Emailing you a reminder about a booking you didn’t finalise, to see if you need any help to do so. We see this as a useful additional service because it lets you carry on with a booking without having to find the parking spot again or fill in all the booking details from scratch.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Sending you a questionnaire or inviting you to review your experience.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Sending you other material related to your booking, such as how to contact us (or another company) if you need help during your booking.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Sending you a summary of your previous bookings.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2">Sending you other administrative messages, which may include security alerts, even if you don’t have an upcoming booking.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Market research</strong>: We may ask you to take part in market research. Any additional personal data that you give us as part of this research will be used only with your consent.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Fraud detection and prevention</strong>: To provide a safe, trustworthy service, we use your personal data to detect and prevent fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities. Similarly, we may use personal data for risk assessment and security purposes, which can include verifying users and bookings. This can sometimes mean we may have to put certain bookings on hold.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Improving our services</strong>: We analyse personal data to help us improve the functionality and quality of our online services, and enhance the whole user experience. We’re always working to make our platforms easier and more enjoyable for you to use.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Customer reviews</strong>: After your booking, we may invite you to review the services that we or our business partner provided. Your review will help future customers make the right choice, and help our business partners improve the services they offer. By submitting a review, you are agreeing that it can be displayed, as explained in our Terms and Conditions. You can make a review anonymously or simply put your first name and city.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Call monitoring</strong>: We may record phone calls and/or allow other staff to listen in to them, to help us train our colleagues and make sure we’re consistently providing a top-quality service. We automatically delete recordings after a specified time, unless we have a legitimate reason not to (if we think there’s evidence of fraud, for example).</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Legal purposes</strong>: Finally, in certain cases, we may need to use your personal data to handle and resolve legal disputes, for regulatory investigations, for compliance reasons, or to make sure we apply our terms and conditions accurately.</li>

                <li class="mb-2">Legitimate interests: We may use your information for our ‘legitimate interests’ (a term which applies to anything we believe is an essential part of carrying out our business effectively – at the same time as respecting your rights and upholding the law). For example, to provide you with the most suitable content on our platforms, including our emails and newsletters; to improve and promote our products and services; and for administrative purposes.</li>

        </header>
        <article>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">There are a number of different business partners integrated in the services we provide, and in certain situations we may share your personal data with them. In most cases, we’re simply passing on your booking details to the business partners that are helping us deliver the service you’re requesting. We will also share your data with other third parties, which may include payment service providers, advertising partners, and – in some cases – the authorities. These are the main reasons we would share your personal data. Would you like to know more?</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside p-3">
                <li class="mb-2">The company/companies supplying your parking spot rental and/or related products and services: To make your booking, we need to send the relevant details to the company/companies supplying the parking spot and/or other related products (including park and ride) that you have requested. These details may include your name, contact details (email, address and phone number), and any preferences you told us about while booking. If there is a dispute about your booking or any other kind of customer service issue, we may need to provide the parking company with some information about the booking process as well as the dispute itself. This may include a copy of your booking confirmation, to prove that a booking was actually made, as well as any information related to your complaint. Please be aware that any information you provide directly to the company/companies supplying your parking spot and/or related products will be stored and used in accordance with their own privacy notice(s) and terms and conditions.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Our business partners: We work with business partners around the world. Some of our partners offer or advertise our services, as well as helping our other business partners offer and advertise their own travel-related services (including insurance). This may mean that their services are integrated into our platforms. When you make a booking on one of our business partners’ platforms, they’ll send us some of the personal data you have provided to them. Similarly, we may send our business partners some of the personal data related to your booking. This could be to help them analyse their business, for example, or to help them run their loyalty programmes. It could also be so that they can send you things like special offers, but only if you’ve given your consent for this. If the business partner provides customer service support, we will send them the details of your booking that they need to give you the support you need. In any of these cases, the handling of your personal data is governed by the privacy notices of these business partners. When you make a booking on a business partner’s website, please take the time to read their privacy notice to see how they handle your personal data. When you buy a product or service provided by one of our business partners, we will send them the personal data they need to provide it. Finally, we may also exchange information about our users with business partners for fraud detection/prevention purposes, but only as strictly necessary.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Competent authorities: We may share your personal data with government or investigative authorities if we’re required to do so by law (or any regulation having the force of law). This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes and criminal investigations. We may also disclose your personal data if strictly necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of fraud and other criminal acts. And we may need to disclose personal data to competent authorities to protect and defend our rights or properties, or the rights or properties of our business partners.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Third-party service providers: We may use third-party service providers to process your personal data on our behalf and support us in providing our services. For example, we may use them to contact you, or to send booking information on our behalf to the company providing the service, or to manage aspects of our site, call centres or marketing activities. We may also use third-party service providers for market research, fraud detection and prevention services, including anti-fraud screening services. These third parties are bound by confidentiality clauses and are not allowed to use your personal data for other purposes.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Advertising partners: We may share your email address and other personal data with third-party advertising partners, so we can make sure you see relevant advertisements when we market our services via third-party business partners. We also work with third-party advertisement networks to market services on other platforms, and with third-party suppliers who help us analyse our own data. All these third parties will be bound by confidentiality agreements and will not be allowed to use your personal data for any other purposes. For more information on personalised advertisements and your choices, please read “How and why do we use these technologies?” and “It’s your choice: Opting in and opting out” in our <a href="/privacy/cookie">Cookie Statement</a>.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Payment service providers and other financial institutions: We also work with third-party payment service providers to arrange payment or payment guarantees. If you (or the holder of the bank card used to make your booking) request a chargeback, we may need to share certain booking details with the payment service provider and the relevant financial institution. This may include a copy of your booking confirmation or the IP address used to make your booking. We may also share information with relevant financial institutions, if we consider it necessary for fraud detection and prevention purposes.</li>

They collect and process your personal data in much the same way as our other platforms do, and they also allow you to find local parking spots based on your current location. Would you like to know more?</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">If you agree to it, we can send ‘push’ notifications straight to your mobile device, so you don’t miss important information about your booking. And, if you let us access your device’s location or contact details, we can provide extra services if you request them. Your mobile device will have instructions on allowing push notifications and giving us access to this kind of data.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">To give you a better service and more relevant marketing, we may use something known as ‘cross-device tracking’. This just means we look at the way you use our platforms on more than one device: we could, for example, combine data from your mobile phone and your home computer. This is something we may or may not use cookies for (for more on cookies and similar technologies, please see our <a href="/privacy/cookie">Cookie Statement</a>).</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">To make sure you find deals that are more likely to interest you in our newsletter, we look at the searches you make and the services you book on multiple devices once you’ve signed in to your user account. If you don’t want us to do this, just sign out before you browse, or unsubscribe from our newsletter.</p>
            <p class="text-xl lg:text-base text-gray-600 leading-normal p-1">Cross-device tracking can also mean that when you’re using one device, you may see personalised advertisements from lots of different companies, based on your activities on linked devices. The NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) should stop this happening if you opt out of the NAI behavioural advertising program (our <a href="/privacy/cookie">Cookie Statement</a> gives you the link you need, under “It's your choice: Opting in and opting out”). Please note: simply signing out of your user account won’t stop this happening.</p>
